<h4 id="htmlcss-lecturer">HTML/CSS Lecturer</h4>

<p class="resume-date">March 2014 – April 2014 (2 months)<br />Tokyo, Japan</p>

<p>Schoo is Japan’s leading online learning platform. I designed and taught a bi-weekly class, an online video-based course for intermediate HTML/CSS developers. I did live-coding a simplified version of websites. Each time, about 500 programmers viewed my lecture on live.</p>
