<p>Schoo (http://schoo.jp) is Japan’s leading online learning platform. I designed and taught a bi-weekly class called “HTML Sketching,” an online video-based course for intermediate HTML/CSS developers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The primary audience of my course was Japanese programmers with some understanding of HTML/CSS, and I taught them techniques to quickly design professional layouts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I did this by live-coding a simplified version of websites like GitHub using HTML/CSS. Every lecture lasted for 90 minutes, and I copied a page on GitHub within this time frame. Each time, about 500 programmers viewed my lecture on live. More details can be found at http://ellekasai.com/talks/.</p>
