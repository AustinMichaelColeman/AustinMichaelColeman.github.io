#### Women Who Code

<p class="resume-date">July 2014 â€“ August 2014 (2 months)<br>Tokyo, Japan</p>

Women Who Code is a global non-profit dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers. I was an organizer and the keynote speaker at the inaugural Women Who Code event in Tokyo. I spoke about how I learned to code, in front of ~20 female programmers.
