#### Junior Product Designer

<p class="resume-date">October 2013 â€“ September 2014 (1 year)<br>Tokyo, Japan</p>

BizReach is Japan's top job site exclusive to business executives who earn > $100k/year. I was the 13th designer to join the team and worked on front-end design (Photoshop) and coding (HTML/CSS).

* My most recent project was Bizreach Woman (https://woman.bizreach.jp/), a job site specifically for female business executives in Japan. I worked with a senior designer to design and code the front page. I also led design and implementation of the event pages (e.g. http://bit.ly/1oDavZY).

* I was an instructor for engineer onboarding. I taught basics of HTML, CSS, and Git to approx. 15 new employees. I prepared my own curriculum and teaching materials. Each session lasted for 3 days.

* I was a HTML/CSS developer for various small projects. In addition to coding the mobile version of http://bizreach.jp, I worked on our responsive HTML email templates.
