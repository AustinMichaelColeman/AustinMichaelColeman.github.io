#### Schoo

<p class="resume-subtitle">HTML/CSS Lecturer</p>

<p class="resume-date">March 2014 â€“ April 2014 (2 months)<br>Tokyo, Japan</p>

Schoo is Japan's leading online learning platform. I designed and taught a bi-weekly class, an online video-based course for intermediate HTML/CSS developers. I did <a href="https://schoo.jp/teacher/336" target="_blank">live-coding</a> a simplified version of websites. Each time, about 500 programmers viewed my lecture on live.
