Schoo is Japan's leading online learning platform. I designed and taught a bi-weekly class, an online video-based course for intermediate HTML/CSS developers. I did <a href="https://schoo.jp/teacher/336" target="_blank">live-coding</a> a simplified version of websites. Each time, about 500 programmers viewed my lecture on live.
