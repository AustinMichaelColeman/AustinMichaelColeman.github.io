#### HTML/CSS Lecturer

<p class="resume-date">March 2014 â€“ April 2014 (2 months)<br>Tokyo, Japan</p>

Schoo is Japan's leading online learning platform. I designed and taught a bi-weekly class, an online video-based course for intermediate HTML/CSS developers. I did live-coding a simplified version of websites. Each time, about 500 programmers viewed my lecture on live.
