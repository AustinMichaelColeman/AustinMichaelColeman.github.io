Net Protections offers online payment solutions for small and large e-commerce companies. As a sales associate, I worked with approx. 100 e-commerce clients and addressed their needs on their payment systems. I also offered installation support my clients after they had purchased our system. Finally, I organized business seminars with our partner companies.
