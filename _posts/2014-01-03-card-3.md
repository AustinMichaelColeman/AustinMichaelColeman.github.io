#### Coding Learner

<p class="resume-date">April 2013 â€“ July 2013 (4 months)<br>San Francisco Bay Area</p>

After leaving Net Protections, I took 3 months off and studied HTML, CSS, and Git. I learned by copying websites like Medium and building my own blogtheme and website. Eventually I came back to Japan, and in Fall 2013, I became a junior product designer at BizReach.
